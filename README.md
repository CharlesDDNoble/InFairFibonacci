# InFairFibonacci
A fibonacci number generator for SPL (Shakespeare Programming Language). SPL is 
an esoteric programming language by Jon Åslund and Karl Hasselström that attempts to 
recreate the writing style of Shakespeare in its source code. See 
[this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_Programming_Language) wikipedia page for more details.

## Running the program
[Shakespearelang](https://github.com/zmbc/shakespearelang) is a pretty nifty project for compiling, running, 
and debugging SPL, check it out. It uses python to parse and run SPL, so any machine that has python installed 
*should* be able to run it!
